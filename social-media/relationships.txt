1. Retrieve a user's followers:
This represents a "one-to-many" relationship where a user can have multiple followers. Each user document contains an array field called "followers" which stores the user IDs of the followers.

db.users.findOne({_id:ObjectId("64b6215beae0ab4c8344cdd4")},{followers:1})

2. Retrieve the comments on a specific post:
This also represents a "one-to-many" relationship. Each user document contains an array field called "posts" which stores the posts created by the user. Each post document within the "posts" array contains an array field called "comments" which stores the comments made on that post. The query retrieves the comments on a specific post by matching the post ID.

db.users.findOne(
    {
        "_id":ObjectId("64b6215beae0ab4c8344cdd4"),
    },
    {
        "posts.comments":1
    }
)


3. Retrieve users who are followed by a specific user:
This represents a "many-to-many" relationship. Each user document contains two array fields: "followers" and "following". The "followers" array stores the user IDs of users who follow the current user, and the "following" array stores the user IDs of users whom the current user follows. The query retrieves the users who are being followed by a specific user by matching the user ID.

db.users.findOne({_id:ObjectId("64b6215beae0ab4c8344cdd5")},{following:1})
